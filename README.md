# Game Swap

Getting tired of a game you own? 

Want to trade it in and dive into a new adventure with no cost?

Hate to trade your game into a local game store and only get $5 for that 1 month old game towards that new game? 

Don't want to waste money on a monthly subscription?

If you answered yes to all the questions above as we did, Game Swap is for you!

Game Swap is a social game trading application that allows users to trade video games with other users in their local area.

# Login and User Search

# Profile and Adding Games to Library

You can guide to your own profile and start expanding your game library as soon as logging in. Clicking "My Profile" in the top right of the page will guide you to your own profile page. You are able to see a profile picture of yourself as well as the ability to add games! Clicking the "Add a Game" button, will direct you to a search to look for games to add to your library. We are searching for the game "Doom 3" below. Clicking the "Add to Library" will redirect you back to the User Search page and add the game to your own library for others to view.

# Trading and Emails

See something interesting on someone's library and looking to trade? Go ahead and click on that "Send a Trade Request" button and an email will be sent right away to the other user alerting them that they have a trade request! This is done by the NodeMailer NPM.
